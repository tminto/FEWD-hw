Additional Comments:

 - Good job! Nice attention to detail in terms of spacing, sizes, and colors. Your HTML is well formatted and your CSS class & ID names are descriptive and consistent.

 - I see a style rule for "article p:first-child:first-letter". You don't need that ":first-child" part. That would be relevant if you were trying to apply a style to a child element of <p>. E.g. if you had an <a> tag nested in your paragraph and wanted to style that. If you remove that you'll see that your :first-letter styling works.

 - You left out the bottom part of the footer. Always double check your design files!
