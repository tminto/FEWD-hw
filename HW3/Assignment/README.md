#FEWD Week #3: CSS Layouts

---

###Description 

Relaxr was really impressed by your work last week and wants you to continue development on their landing page. Using the concpets you learned in class you will work to build out a more complex layout for their company site. They decided on creating a blog, and their back-end engineers will be focused on developing the blog's functionality. They want your front-end skills to style their designs using HTML and CSS so Relaxr's engineers can begin integrating. Once again, the designers have handed you a basic [design file with instructions](starter_code/readme) and the JPEG below to help you bring the blog to life. Submit the finished version for homework.
