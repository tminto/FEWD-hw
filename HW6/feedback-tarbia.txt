Everything is working. Your array and for loop look good. And nice use of (this)!

One little thing: It's better to use === in the conditional (instead of ==). === is more exact than == (which sometimes gives you weird results). For instance:
  3 == "3"    is true (even though "3" is a string, not a number) but
  3 === "3"   is false like you'd expect
Basically, unless you have a specific reason to use ==, it's better to use ===.

Overall, well done!
