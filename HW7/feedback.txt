Use media queries at a 768px breakpoint
 - Good!
As a user changes the size of a browser window:

Content remains in appropriate divs
 - Good!
Content remains visible to the user
 - Good use of percent based with on the content wrapper to achieve a scalable layout
 - Your "#benfits ul" styling stays at hard coded 600px width, which causes some display problems on smaller screens. Changing this to a percent based width could solve this.
 - Hiding the sidebar on the blog page keeps the page from being cramped, but you could also switch to a vertical layout
Fonts change size appropriately
 - Good use of font resizing in your menu
Margins and padding change size appropriately
 - Good!
Content does not overlap
 - Good!
In the blog section, the two-column layout changes to a single-column layout when appropriate
 - Good!

Additional Comments:
 - Good job overall. The updated spacing and text size maintain a nice mobile layout

 - There are a couple hard coded pixel widths in the default CSS that aren't being switched to percentage based widths in your media query. These are causing some display problems at smaller resolutions.
